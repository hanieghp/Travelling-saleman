advanced programming project    
The game is played in such a way that both players enter the map from a common point by throwing dice. In each turn, the player can move in any direction he likes. He must look for a treasure announced by the computer (quest) in every turn and after passing the houses and finding the desired treasure, go to the castle and announce its location. Finally, after all the treasures have been found by the itinerant sellers, the player who has found more treasures will win the game and can own the game castle.
